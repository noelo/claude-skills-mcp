**How we use Color:**
Looking like Red Hat requires more than just using the colors in our palette. The amount of each color used and where it appears is just as impactful. To use color consistently, follow these core principles.

- Keep it simple: Use restrained, stylized color. Keep things simple and use generous white space to put a spotlight on the message and allow our audience to focus on what matters.

- Use red, with intention: Red Hat red is a strong color. Rather than flooding an entire space, use pops of red to highlight key elements of the composition.

- Create balance: Fill large objects and backgrounds with the lightest tints, darkest shades, and subtle gradients. Use the most saturated color values sparingly—to call something out, help with navigation, or add richness.

- Consider color sources: Zoom out and pay attention to the colors of all elements in the composition. Consider how they work together and where attention is being directed.

**What to avoid:**
- Don't use colors outside of the Red Hat color palette.
- Don't flood everything with Red Hat red (red-50). Red is a strong color. Use it to add pops of color.
- Don't use more than 2 secondary colors in one visual. The fewer colors, the better.
- Don't forget to use Red Hat red (red-50). Everything from Red Hat should include red-50.
- Don't use colors that aren't accessible. Always check the contrast ratio of text and other elements against the background color.
- Avoid overusing gradients. Use gradients to add subtle depth and richness.

**Providing context with color:**
- red: Red Hat	Red is our brand color. Do not use red to represent negative things.
- danger-orange: Danger, decrease, Something negative has occurred, like a destructive error or a decrease in value.
- orange: Caution: A non-destructive action or error has occurred.
- yellow: Warning: Take action now to avoid a destructive action or error.
- success-green: Success, increase	Something positive has occurred, like a successful action or increase in value.
- interaction-blue: Link or interaction, Clicking the object or text leads to a hyperlink or state change.
- purple: Info or note tip, Helpful information is available.
- gray: Neutral, A button or information is unavailable or unimportant.

### Typography

**Fonts**
Our default font—and the one used in our logo—is Red Hat Display. Geometric, sans serif letterforms with even strokes reinforce our tone of voice and reflect our technical expertise and engineering. Meanwhile, human touches—like curved details, tapered links, and angled ascenders—disrupt the rigidity to represent our people and call back to our brand’s history.
We use Red Hat Display at large sizes or in bold (or both) to grab attention. If you’re not sure which font to use, default to Display.
Red Hat Text takes all of the personality from Display and optimizes it for more demanding applications. As the name implies, it’s easier to read in paragraphs or when text is used at small sizes—like in a whitepaper or tooltip.
Red Hat Mono was created to distinguish code from natural-language text. Mono stands for monospaced, meaning each letter takes up the same amount of horizontal space. This creates neat columns of text and makes scanning code easier.Mono should only be used when demonstrating code snippets in communications and interfaces, or as a stylistic approach for a more technical audience.

**Applying Fonts:**
How we apply our fonts, also known as typography, can be just as impactful as the design of the fonts themselves. We write the way that real people talk, so we use our fonts in a way that reflects that.The basics of typography at Red Hat align to our brand personality traits.
- Make it open : Highlight the message using white space rather than filling the entire page with text. Use generous margins and consider editing the length of the copy before decreasing margins or font size to fit more.

- Make it authentic: Our words should be real and friendly, so we always type in sentence case rather than title case or all caps (yes, even for headlines). We follow a straightforward approach to typography, letting the words speak for themselves with minimal formatting or ornamentation. Lean into how text naturally occurs on screens, because that’s where our audience spends their time.

- Make it helpful: We’re consistent with how we apply our fonts across applications so that our audience knows what to expect when they hear from us. Being helpful also means making our words accessible to everyone. Make text readable—with comfortable line spacing (leading) and line length—and legible—with appropriate contrast against the background.

Make it brave: Our font has a lot of personality and we like to show it off. We use prominent headlines that grab attention. Make it big, make it bold, or make it both. Respect the reader’s time and be confident in what we’re saying. Make the copy concise and compelling, then use type hierarchy to guide the reader through the story.

**What To Use:**
- Use our fonts: Red Hat Display, Text, and Mono.
- Use generous margins and a lot of white space.
- Use sentence case (yes, even for headlines).
- Make sure text is readable and legible.
- Let the words speak for themselves.
- Grab attention by making headlines big, bold, or both.

**What to avoid:**
- Don't use random fonts.
- Don't fill an entire space with text, it's overwhelming.
- Never use all caps, it's too aggressive.
- Avoid text that lacks appropriate contrast.
- Avoid unnecessary ornamentation.
- Don't increase or decrease text tracking.
